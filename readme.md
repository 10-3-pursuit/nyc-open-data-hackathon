## Introduction

Welcome to the [NYC Open Data API](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) Hackathon! This event challenges you to unleash your creativity and technical skills to innovate solutions using the [NYC Open Data API](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Whether you're building a web app, mobile app, tool, or any other digital creation, your project should aim to solve real-world problems and have the potential to scale into a viable product or service.

## Requirements

- **Use of [NYC Open Data API](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)**: Your project must integrate the [NYC Open Data API](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Creativity in how you use this API is highly encouraged.
- **Project Types:** You can build a web app, mobile app, Chrome DevTool, npm package, or any other digital creation of your choosing.
- **Additional APIs**: You are welcome to use other APIs to create mashups or enhance your application's functionality. Oftentimes mashups look at overlapping data from multiple APIs to pull out new relationships. Valuable mashups can be as simple as using a site’s API and redesigning the interface through which users view the data.
- **Submission**: Provide a public URL to your code repository in your readme.md. Include instructions on what your app does, the problems it solves, and how to run it. Submit your link to the event panel (instructors).

## Prizes

- **Winner Takes All:** Prizes will be exclusively awarded to the winning team. Each winning member who fully participates will receive a $35 e-gift certificate, with the choice of Amazon, Grubhub, or DoorDash. Full participation is required for eligibility. The winning team will be announced on Tuesday May 21st.

## Judging Criteria

Winners will not be chosen by the hackathon instructors. The winning team
will be determined by a chosen panel of judges who will review a video of your presentations.

Team will be judged based on:

1. **Progress**: How much was accomplished during the hackathon?
2. **Concept**: Does the solution address a real and significant problem?
3. **Feasibility**: Could this project evolve into a startup or company?
4. **Presentation**: Quality of the presentation deck and effectiveness in communicating your concept.
5. **Innovative Use of API**: How creatively and effectively the solution uses the [NYC Open Data API](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).

## Presentation

Each team will give a 5 minute presentation on Monday, May 20th. Make sure your presentation captures the essence and impact of your solution effectively.

## Get Started
